    The Java programming language provides operators to perform arithmetic operations:

    addition +
    subtraction -
    multiplication *
    integer division /
    remainder %
    The operators are called binary because they take two values as operands.

    The following example prints results of addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

            System.out.println(13 + 25); // prints 38
System.out.println(20 + 70); // prints 90

System.out.println(70 - 30); // prints 40
System.out.println(30 - 70); // prints -40

System.out.println(21 * 3);  // prints 63
System.out.println(20 * 10); // prints 200
    The / operator returns the integer part of the division of two integer numbers, and any fractional part is discarded.

            System.out.println(8 / 3); // prints 2
System.out.println(41 / 5); // prints 8
    The % in Java is the modulus or remainder operator. It returns the remainder of the division of two numbers. Note, that when the dividend is less than the divisor, the quotient is zero and the remainder equals the dividend. If you still feel uneasy about modulo operation, check out the wiki.

            System.out.println(10 % 3) // prints 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1
            System.out.println(12 % 4) // prints 0, because 12 divided by 4 leaves no remainder
            System.out.println(5 % 9) // prints 5, because 5 divided by 9 leaves a remainder 5
