  /* Program – a sequence of instructions (called statements), which are executed one after another in a predictable manner. Sequential flow is the most common and straightforward sequence of statements, in which statements are executed in the order that they are written – from top to bottom in a sequential manner;
    Statement – a single action (like print a text) terminated by semi-colon (;);
    Block – a group of zero, one or more statements enclosed by a pair of braces {...}; There are two such blocks in the program above.
            Method – a sequence of statements that represents a high-level operation (also known as subprogram or procedure).
    Syntax – a set of rules that define how a program needs to be written in order to be valid; Java has its own specific syntax that we will learn;
    Keyword – a word that has a special meaning in the programming language (public, class, and many others). These words cannot be used as variable names for your own program;
    Identifier or name – a word that refers to something in a program (such as a variable or a function name);
    Comment – a textual explanation of what the code does. Java comments start with //.
    Whitespace – all characters that are not visible (space, tab, newline, etc.).
